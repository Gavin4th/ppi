In addition  entityone  dissociates from  entitytwo  upon binding of MHC class I leader sequence peptides	True
The correlation between  entityone  and MHC class I surface expression might be relevant to the function of  entitytwo 	False
Our results also show that although these  entityone  binding peptides are derived from signal sequences they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the  entitytwo  complex and loaded onto HLAE molecules	False
Our results also show that although these  entityone  binding peptides are derived from signal sequences they may be released back into the cytosol and subsequently translocated by the  otherprotein  complex and loaded onto  entitytwo  molecules	False
